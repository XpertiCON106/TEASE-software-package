# Project TEASE
Thermo-Electric Atmospheric Sustainable Energy (TEASE) Ballon payload project

The purpose of this project is to design, manufacture, test, launch, & evaluate scientific data collection & engineering demonstration payloads flown on weather balloons up to 100,000 ft.In addition, be able to plan, implement, and perform payload recovery procedures.

In addition, there must be a system that conducts electricity using a Peltier module â€“ the temperature difference at 100K ft. creates a heat flux between the junctions of two different materials leading to electricity. 

This repository includes the code that is required for data collection for this project. The software collects inside temperature, outside temperature,  and voltage difference and transfers them to an SD card.
