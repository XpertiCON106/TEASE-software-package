# TEASE-software-package
Thermo-Electric Atmospheric Sustainable Energy (TEASE) Ballon payload project

The purpose of this project is to design, manufacture, test, launch, & evaluate scientific data collection & engineering demonstration payloads flown on weather balloons up to 100,000 ft.In addition, be able to plan, implement, and perform payload recovery procedures.

In addition, there must be a system that conducts electricity using a Peltier module â€“ the temperature difference at 100K ft. creates a heat flux between the junctions of two different materials leading to electricity. 

This repository contains the files/libraries and other components that are needed to run the software end of the project.
