# Project TEASE
Thermo-Electric Atmospheric Sustainable Energy (TEASE) Ballon payload project

The purpose of this project is to design, manufacture, test, launch, & evaluate scientific data collection & engineering demonstration payloads flown on weather balloons up to 100,000 ft.In addition, be able to plan, implement, and perform payload recovery procedures.

In addition, there must be a system that conducts electricity using a Peltier module â€“ the temperature difference at 100K ft. creates a heat flux between the junctions of two different materials leading to electricity. 

This repository contains the files/libraries and other components that are needed to run the software end of the project. 

# Materials needed
If you intend on doing this project by yourself, you must need couple of things first

1: Peltier Module <https://www.adafruit.com/product/1331>

2: Temperature Sensor <https://www.adafruit.com/product/381>

3: A Camera (for taking some good space pics)

4: Handwarmers (for keeping the internal temp near boiling point)

5: Aluminum sheets

6: Joule Thief <http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/272420105646?chn=ps&dispItem=1>

The joule thief is really for powering an LED with the peltier module. It acts as a bridge. 

7: Arduino 

8: Jumper cables

9: starter shield (which I don't know the name of)

10: SD card module (which I don't know the name of)

11: Clock (which I don't know the name of)

12: Cardboard

13: Engineering tools
