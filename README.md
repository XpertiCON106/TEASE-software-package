# TEASE-software-and-hardware-integration
Thermo-Electric Atmospheric Sustainable Energy (TEASE) Ballon payload project

The purpose of this project is to design, manufacture, test, launch, & evaluate scientific data collection & engineering demonstration payloads flown on weather balloons up to 100,000 ft.In addition, be able to plan, implement, and perform payload recovery procedures.

In addition, there must be a system that conducts electricity using a Peltier module â€“ the temperature difference at 100K ft. creates a heat flux between the junctions of two different materials leading to electricity. 

This repository contains the files/libraries and other components that are needed to run the software end of the project. 

# Materials needed
If you intend on doing this project by yourself, you must need couple of things first

1: Peltier Module <https://www.adafruit.com/product/1331>

2: Temperature Sensor <https://www.adafruit.com/product/381>

3: A Camera

4: Handwarmers..

5: 15 kpi Sheet Aluminum

6: Joule Thief <http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/272420105646?chn=ps&dispItem=1>

In addition, you need an arduino, jumper cables, a battery
